title: Connection & Polling
description: Configuring how GivLocal connects to and polls your inverter.
---

Open **Settings → Connection** to control how often GivLocal fetches data and how it communicates with your hardware.

## Refresh intervals

| Setting | Description | Default |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| Live Data Refresh | How often the Dashboard updates (power flow, battery SOC, quick stats) | 10 seconds |
| Full Telemetry Refresh | How often the slower, more detailed register read runs | Longer interval |

Live data refresh can be set between 10 and 120 seconds. A shorter interval gives more responsive readings but generates more network traffic to the inverter.

## Polling method

Controls how GivLocal reads data from the inverter:

| Method | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Default | Splits live data and detail reads into separate passes. Recommended for most setups. |
| Full Telemetry | Reads all data in a single pass. Useful for diagnostics but slower. |
| Battery Meter | Polling optimised for battery meter-style monitoring. |

If you are unsure which method to use, run the **Connection Benchmark** tool in **Settings → Diagnostics** — it tests each method against your hardware and recommends the best fit.

## Quick Actions power settings

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Use Max Power for Quick Charge | Temporarily raises the battery charge power limit when Charge Now is tapped |
| Use Max Power for Quick Discharge | Temporarily raises the battery discharge power limit when Discharge Now is tapped |

When enabled, quick actions use the maximum hardware-supported power rate rather than your configured power limit. The limit is restored when the quick action ends.
